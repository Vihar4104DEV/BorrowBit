- **CSS support**: Full CSS styling capabilities
- **Font support**: Custom fonts and typography
- **Print optimization**: Optimized for printing
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Template System

The default template includes:

- **Header**: Company logo, name, and contact information
- **Invoice Details**: Invoice number, dates, and customer information
- **Items Table**: Product details, quantities, and prices
- **Totals Section**: Subtotal, tax, discount, and grand total
- **Footer**: Terms, conditions, and company information

### Customization

You can customize the invoice appearance by:

1. **Creating a custom template** in the admin interface
2. **Modifying the HTML template** in `pdf_generator.py`
3. **Adding custom CSS styles** for branding
4. **Uploading company logo** in the template settings

## Testing

Run the test script to verify PDF generation:

```bash
cd borrowbit
python invoices/test_invoice_pdf.py
```

This will:
1. Create a test user
2. Create a sample invoice with items
3. Generate PDF files
4. Display test results

## Admin Interface

The Django admin provides comprehensive invoice management:

- **Invoice List**: View all invoices with filters and search
- **Invoice Details**: Edit invoice information and items
- **PDF Generation**: Generate PDFs directly from admin
- **Bulk Actions**: Mark multiple invoices as paid/sent
- **Template Management**: Create and edit invoice templates

## Configuration

### Settings

Add these settings to your `settings.py`:

```python
# Invoice settings
INVOICE_PDF_STORAGE_PATH = 'invoices/pdfs/'
INVOICE_TEMPLATE_STORAGE_PATH = 'invoice_templates/'

# WeasyPrint settings (optional)
WEASYPRINT_OPTIONS = {
    'encoding': 'utf-8',
    'presentational_hints': True,
}
```

### Media Files

Ensure your media files are properly configured:

```python
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
```

## Security

- **Authentication Required**: All invoice views require login
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own invoices
- **Admin Protection**: Admin views require staff permissions
- **File Validation**: PDF files are validated before storage

## Performance

- **Lazy PDF Generation**: PDFs are generated on-demand
- **Caching**: PDF files are cached to avoid regeneration
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries with select_related
- **File Storage**: PDFs stored in media directory for fast access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WeasyPrint Installation**
   ```bash
   # On Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools python3-wheel python3-cffi libcairo2 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libffi-dev shared-mime-info
   
   # On macOS
   brew install cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi
   
   # On Windows
   # Download and install GTK+ runtime
   ```

2. **PDF Generation Fails**
   - Check WeasyPrint installation
   - Verify template syntax
   - Check file permissions for media directory

3. **Template Not Loading**
   - Ensure template is marked as active
   - Check HTML syntax in template
   - Verify company information is set
